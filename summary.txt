The Concept: The BF16 format uses 2 bytes per number.
    High Byte (MSB): Contains the sign and exponent. In neural networks, weights tend to be in the same order of magnitude, making this byte very repetitive and highly compressible.
    Low Byte (LSB): Contains the mantissa (precision). This byte varies a lot and looks like random "noise", being difficult to compress.

The Technique: Instead of compressing the file sequentially (MSB, LSB, MSB, LSB...), you should separate the data into two streams:
    Group all High Bytes into one block.
    Group all Low Bytes into another block.
    Compress the resulting blocks using a fast and efficient algorithm like Zstd.

Why use it: Compressors work by finding repeated patterns. By grouping the exponents, you create long sequences of identical or similar bytes, drastically improving the compression ratio.

Performance:
    Ratio: Superior to direct compression (in my quick tests, it improved about 10% over pure Zstd).
    Time: Very fast (only requires simple memory operations before compressing).
    Memory: Low (you can process the file in "chunks" of 10MB or 100MB to avoid loading 1GB into RAM).
